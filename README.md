# Personalized content recommendation chatbot (Thesis LaTeX Doc)

This thesis work explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as a user communication interface in a recommendation system. 
These models are used to search for personalized content in response to natural language queries. 
The recommendation system is capable of offering personalized content to the user and addressing the cold start problem through an _ensemble_ 
of content-based recommendation models, collaborative filters, and language models.

**Keywords:** _LLM_, _Cold Start_, collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems, content-based recommendation systems, _Rest API_, _RAG_, _ChromaDB_, _Apache Airflow_, _Llama_, deep factoring machines (_DeepFM_).
